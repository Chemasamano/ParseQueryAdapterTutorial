ParseQueryAdapterTutorial
=========================

This sample code is for the [ParseQueryAdapter tutorial on Parse](https://parse.com/tutorials/parse-query-adapter). 

To test this project, add your client key and app ID to the Application class, build and run the project. You will need to create a class called 'Todo' in your Data Browser, and include the fields 'title' (string), 'image' (file), and 'highPri' (boolean). 

This project does not include the ability to upload photos or create new todos; it is read-only. For an example of a ParseQueryAdapter in a full app, please see the [MealSpotting tutorial](parse.com/tutorials/mealspotting).
